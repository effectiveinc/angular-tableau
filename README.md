# AngularJS Directive for Tableau

This is an Angular module that provides a service and directive for easily embedding Tableau visualizations within
your Angular app.

It's built with [Angular 1.4.x](https://angularjs.org) and [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com) and targets modern browsers 
(latest Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, IE10+) and Tableau Server 9.1 - 9.3.

## Usage

1. Install the component (e.g. with Bower). If needed, manually add a script tag to your HTML to load the 
  lib/tableau.js file
  
2. Add a dependency on the `angularjs.tableau` module in your Angular app module:

      ````
      angular.module('myApp', ['angularjs.tableau']);
      ````

3. Currently, you must manually add the Tableau Server script tag to your main HTML page, per the 
  [Tableau instructions](http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/api/js_api/en-us/JavaScriptAPI/js_api_concepts_get_API.htm) 
  
4. To embed a visualization, decorate a `div` or other element with the `eui-tableau-viz` attribute. The value of
  this attribute should be the workbook/view path for the desired visualization, as defined on the Tableau server
  (this can be found in Tableau embed code blocks as the "name" parameter. Encoded HTML entities should be decoded, 
  so e.g. if your Tableau embed code contains `<param name='name' value='MyWorkbook&#47;MyViz' />`, enter this as
  `MyWorkbook/MyViz`). Also, you'll need to specify a `viz-height` attribute on the same element, to tell the 
  visualization how tall it should be (its width will behave like a block-level element and fill its container).
  Example:
    `<div eui-tableau-viz="MyWorkbook/MyViz" viz-height="200px"></div>`

## Contributing

1. Install a current version of Node.js (built with v4.2.4) from https://nodejs.org/
2. Install Bower: `npm install -g bower`
3. Install Gulp: `npm install -g gulp`
4. cd to the project root and install dependencies: `npm install && bower install`

NOTE: Node.js is only used for the development environment; it is not required for the component itself at runtime.

You can use the following commands:

- `$ gulp` to build the component and demo app in folder dist
- `$ gulp serve` to start BrowserSync server on your source files with live reload
- `$ gulp serve:dist` to start BrowserSync server on your optimized application without live reload
- `$ gulp test` to run your unit tests with Karma
- `$ gulp test:auto` to run your unit tests with Karma in watch mode
